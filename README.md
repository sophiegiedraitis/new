Annual Dollar Usage is a metric that measures the total annual cost of an inventory item by multiplying its annual demand by its unit cost, helping prioritize inventory management decisions.

• Item 5 has low demand but high unit cost, resulting in high annual dollar usage and requiring close monitoring and tighter cost control

• Item 3 has high demand but low unit cost, allowing for lighter monitoring and simplified inventory controls

• Remaining items fall into a moderate range and can be regularly monitored using standard inventory practices
